RPi LED
======

Overview
---
This is a simple system to control programmable LED strip(s) with a Raspberry Pi. A detailed explanation of the setup
and the wiring is coming soon. 


Must run both webapp.py and ledcontroller.py as superuser in separate console windows. Something such as TMUX helps alot.
